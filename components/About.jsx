                        I specialize in building responsive fullstack web applications. Iâ€™m
                        passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
                        more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
                        in building fullstack applications using the MERN Stack and NextJS, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
                        needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
                        specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.

                        I started web developement in 2020 when I joined WebAc@demie by Epitech. 
                        I&apos;ve learned all my skills there by doing projects during 2 years. 
                        In my spare time I do some personal projects and learn new technologies.
